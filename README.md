# belly-button-biodiversity

## Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of this challange was to complete the dashboard with added visualizations for the bacterial data for each volunteer that Roza took belly button samples from. The dashboard now allows her volunteers to be able to identify the top 10 bacterial species in their belly buttons at the click of a button.
